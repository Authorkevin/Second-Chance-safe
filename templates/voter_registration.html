            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">With a little planning and preparation, you can make sure your vote counts. Registering to vote in Oklahoma is simple, and there are multiple ways to do it.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Applications can be accepted anytime, but to be eligible to vote in any certain election, applications have to be received <span class="font-semibold">25 days prior to the date of that election</span>.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You can find voter registration deadlines and election events on the <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/elections.html" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800">State Election Board Website</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Voter Eligibility</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You can register to vote if you are a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State of Oklahoma, and at least 18 years old or meet the age requirement to pre-register.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Pre-registration</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Persons who are at least 17½ years old may pre-register to vote in Oklahoma if they meet all eligibility requirements. Applicants who pre-register cannot vote until they turn 18 years old and the application has been approved by the applicant's County Election Board Secretary. Applicants will be mailed a Voter ID card upon approval of their registration.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Voting with a Background</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">If you have completed your sentence of court-mandated calendar days, including any term of incarceration, parole, probation, or supervision ordered by any court, you may register to vote.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A person with a felony conviction, who has been pardoned, may register to vote.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">If you are in jail awaiting trial or were convicted of a misdemeanor in Oklahoma, you are eligible to vote. If you are in jail or incarcerated for a misdemeanor, but a registered voter, you must vote by absentee ballot.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You must request an absentee ballot in advance from your designated County Election Board.</p>
